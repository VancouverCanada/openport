# OpenPort v0.1.0 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-13

## Highlights

- Initial public release of OpenPort as an independent, security-first AI access runtime.
- Standardized `agent/v1` contract for manifest, read endpoints, preflight, action creation, and draft retrieval.
- Draft-first action model with controlled auto-execute for low/high-risk operations.
- Built-in policy controls for scopes, tenant boundary, IP allowlist, and date-window restrictions.
- OpenAPI contract and automated route-coverage checks.
- Release gate automation and CI checks for secret and boundary leak prevention.
- Public adapter repository template for teams building custom adapters without exposing private business logic.

## Included in this release

- Runtime: Fastify reference server and library entrypoints
- Adapters: in-memory, Postgres, Prisma
- Specs: `spec/openport-v1.openapi.yaml`
- Docs: architecture, security threat model, extraction boundary, migration plan, release gate
- Governance: MIT license, SECURITY policy, CODEOWNERS, contribution guide

## Compatibility

- Node.js: `>=20` (recommended: Node 22)
- Package manager: npm

## Known limits in v0.1.0

- Reference server persistence for app/key/draft metadata is in-memory only.
- No built-in SIEM exporter; audit sink is pluggable.
- Example adapter template is scaffold-level and requires endpoint mapping by adopters.

## Upgrade / adoption guidance

1. Start with in-memory mode for protocol validation.
2. Move to Postgres or custom adapter after contract and policy checks are stable.
3. Keep product-specific identity and business logic in a separate adapter repository.

## Security posture

This release includes:

- hashed token validation
- immediate key revocation enforcement
- action idempotency and preflight checks for high-risk execution
- policy-denial auditing
- automated safety and boundary scans

Report vulnerabilities via `SECURITY.md`.
